# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview of Project

Improbable Beef, a food startup, is looking for bacteria that provides the right taste to their synthesized meat. The laboratory they partnered with believes the ideal bacterial species may be found in the belly button, so they collected samples from people across the country. I will be building a dashboard using Plotly so researchers and participants can access the data.
